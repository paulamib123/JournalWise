It's taken three months to get here and it seems kinda slow but I am so worried about extra skin and sticking to it that I want to take it slow so I know I will be happy with myself when Im done. I want to lose the 200lbs and stay there so I will take my time, even if it takes me more than a year to do so.\\n\\nEdit: Wow, I didnt expect my post to get so much attention. I was just hoping for a few encouraging comments but holy cow I got so many more than that. Thank you all for your kind words and thank you to everyone who gave me an award.

She has been fighting with her exh for months to get their son looked at properly and treated. Finally, she got a neurologist to look at footage of him walking around and was very concerned, wanted to schedule an MRI and see him immediately. That was 2 weeks ago. Last week they went in and got the results, and it was a whirlwind flight to the children\\u2019s hospital and surgery the very next day.\\n\\nI am extremely grateful for all the doctors and staff, and for my GF for never giving up, she KNEW there was something wrong, but didn\\u2019t know what. We all saw how he was, the headaches, vomiting, lack of sleep, the circles under his eyes, and how he had lost so much weight. He has been sick and fighting this alone for so long, having no one but his mom believing he was sick.\\n\\nThis is where I\\u2019m angry; his dad has thought that his boy was fine this whole time. He has denied that there was anything wrong with his son. He has fought against his exw (my gf) every single step of the way. He said that it was her house and care that was making him sick, he even went so far as to start telling doctors, child therapists, and family counselors that she was mentally ill and she was making him (the child) sick. He\\u2019s a very convincing narcissist, and I want to throw him out of the window. He has gaslighted all of them so much that my gf was hating herself, he has manipulated the children (they have a daughter together too,) into thinking that the only way they would be safe was in his care.\\n\\nHer family and I have been advocating for her this whole time, reassuring her that no, it\\u2019s not her fault, her son is in fact unwell, and she needs to explore every avenue to find a solution. 10months later, we find out she was right all along. What a shit thing to be right about, how could you be happy for cancer? But it  proves that this man is evil incarnate. He doesn\\u2019t deserve to have children. \\n\\nSorry for discombobulated thoughts and ranting, it\\u2019s 6am and I\\u2019m about to drive 3.5 hours to spend an afternoon with my gf for moral support. I wish I could be there more, but she lives the next state over.\",\n          \"The other morning I was really sick. It was my time of the month and (due to PCOS) I was in a lot of pain. I stayed home from work and spent the night using my boyfriend as a heating pad. He babied me all night and did whatever he could to take care of me. I ended up falling asleep in his lap. He moved me to my spot in the bed, which woke me up, but I was enjoying him doing this that I shamelessly faked being asleep.  He laid down behind me, wrapped his arm around me, kissed my forehead, and said, \\u201cbaby I love you so much. You mean the world to me. Thank you for making me so happy. I hope you feel better. I love you.\\u201d I had to fight back tears. I didn\\u2019t mention to him that I heard it because I\\u2019m afraid he\\u2019ll stop doing it. I\\u2019ve been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts my whole life but hearing this made me feel at peace for once.\\n\\nEdit: I know there\\u2019s some of you that don\\u2019t want to believe this because the title is \\u201cclickbait\\u201d and \\u201cthis has been posted before.\\u201d I understand that and I hate that people have become so numb to this stuff that they don\\u2019t believe it can happen commonly. Admittedly, I didn\\u2019t even look through the sub before posting. I was swooning and caught up in my feels and wanted to share. I figured that with all the negativity going on in the world, along with all the mental health struggles I have endured myself, posting something happy and positive would be a good thing. Obviously I can\\u2019t force anyone to believe me but I wish people would try.\\n\\nBut for those that do, thank you for all the nice comments!

I dug deep into the recesses of my brain, because I'm a master procrastinator and avoider, so I couldn't even readily put my finger on all the things that wake me up in the middle of the night filled with fear. \\n\\nAt the very top of my list was a student loan that defaulted in September. I feel ashamed of it, and regretful for letting it go into default. All those letters from the Dept. of Ed that I would just toss, unopened, onto the kitchen counter when I got home...I was actually terrified to open those letters, so I just didn't. \\n\\nI'm learning that if I deal with something while it's small, it's much less stressful and scary. I'm 34 and I'm sad to say I'm just now learning that. Better now then never, right? \\n\\nI spent 2 hours, 11 minutes, and 36 seconds on the phone yesterday with the collection agency that now holds my loan. I was scared to death to call, but they were extremely kind. We set up payments. They walked me through the paperwork, step by step, and allowed me to photograph the signed papers and email it to them directly instead of mailing them in and further delaying the process. \\n\\nI felt like an elephant had been removed from my chest when we hung up. I have payments set for automatic draft, so I won't miss any. I have to make consistent payments for nine months before I will be out of default, and I'm perfectly fine with this. \\n\\nIf anyone else is struggling under the crushing weight of student loan debt and losing sleep over it, I want to encourage you to open that mail, call the 1-800 number, and admit that you need help. It's not nearly as scary as my brain said it is. I hope this encourages someone to deal with a similar issue.\\n\\nEdit: thank you for the silver, kind stranger!\",\n          \"My wife got the official results from her COVID-19 test today showing what we already knew: positive. My youngest son also has it based on deductive reasoning.\\n\\nWe\\u2019ve spent the last 6-7 months being careful. Wearing our masks, maintains distance even from close family members. We only spent time with a select few people who we know were also being extremely careful.\\n\\nWe stopped volunteering for our church live-stream because they insisted on bringing people back for Sunday worship.\\n\\nWe only leave our house out of necessity (work, groceries, etc.).\\n\\nMy grandfather just got sent to the emergency room, just months after we lost my grandmother. So, we can\\u2019t go see him even if he\\u2019s able to go home.\\n\\nWe saw my mom and my MIL less than 10 days before my wife started showing symptoms, so now they have to quarantine.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s possible that I won\\u2019t have enough PTO at my job to keep it if/when I inevitably contract it from my wife.\\n\\nNot to mention the clients I have that are COVID deniers.\\n\\nI\\u2019m so angry because we did everything right and we still ended up getting it.\\n\\nI\\u2019m angry at the asshole deniers. I\\u2019m angry at our dumbass politicians doing fucking nothing. I\\u2019m angry at my church for being more worried about congregating than about safety. I\\u2019m angry at the people who claimed that it wasn\\u2019t a big deal. I\\u2019m angry at those who refused to wear masks.\\n\\nAnd despite knowing that I did everything I was supposed to, I\\u2019m angry at myself for not doing more.\\n\\n\\nEDIT: Thank you all for the kind words, with the thread locked I can\\u2019t reply to you.

I work at a grocery store. Yesterday, a man refused to wear a mask because he has asthma. I told him I would not ring up his groceries until he put it on. He did, but not without raising his voice at me and telling me he had already called his lawyer and we were all being sued.\\n\\nThen, at closing time, a woman was wearing her mask around her neck. I asked her (very nicely, seriously) to please pull it up when she comes through the line. She nodded and pulled it up. When I got off, she drove by me in the parking lot screaming \\u201cfuck you!\\u201d over and over. Then she pulled up next to me at a red light and screamed more. I *highly* regret not taking a video of her. That\\u2019s really the only thing about that interaction that\\u2019s bothering me. That I didn\\u2019t get her face on video. \\n\\nI am just trying to do my job and not bring this virus home with me. I\\u2019m just trying to ring up your groceries and protect myself and my family.

I asked her (very nicely, seriously) to please pull it up when she comes through the line. She nodded and pulled it up. When I got off, she drove by me in the parking lot screaming \\u201cfuck you!\\u201d over and over. Then she pulled up next to me at a red light and screamed more.

        "#   Below is an additional description of each of these cognitive distortion labels.\n",
        "#   Catastrophizing - When individuals consistently imagine the worst possible outcome in a situation, even when it's unlikely or improbable. This can lead to heightened anxiety, fear, and a sense of being overwhelmed. It's essentially a form of negative thinking where minor issues are blown out of proportion, and the focus is solely on negative possibilities.\n",
        "#   Overgeneralization - When major conclusions are drawn based on limited information, or some large group is said to have same behavior or property. For example: “one nurse was rude to me, this means all medical staff must be rude.” or “last time I was in the pool I almost drowned, I am a terrible swimmer and should not go into the water again”.\n",
        "#   Mind Reading - Any evidence of the speaker suspecting what others are thinking or what are the motivations behind their actions. Statements like “they won’t understand”, “they dislike me” suggest mind reading distortion. However, “she said she dislikes me” is not a distortion, but “I think she dislikes me since she ignored me” is again mind reading distortion (since it is based on assumption that you know why someone behaved in a certain way).\n",
        "#   Personalization - Personalizing or taking up the blame for a situation which is not directly related to the speaker. This could also be assigning the blame to someone who was not responsible for the situation that in reality involved many factors and was out of your/the person’s control. The first entry in the sample is a good example for this.\n",
        "#   Emotional Reasoning - Basically, this distortion can be summed up as - “If I feel that way, it must be true.” Whatever a person is feeling is believed to be true automatically and unconditionally. One of the most common representation of this is some variation of – ‘I feel like a failure so I must be a failure’. It does not always have to be about the speaker themselves, “I feel like he is not being honest with me, he must be hiding something” is also an example of emotional reasoning.\n",

I've been in love  with this woman for a very long time, maybe a couple of years at this  point and I'm not sure if I should just kill it or attempt to make  something with her.\\n\\nI met my  ex-wife, her sister, when I was 23-years-old and the relationship  developed very quickly and by 26 I had my son and daugther and had  gotten married. However, within months of being married my ex-wife had  an affair, but worse than that the man she cheated with had gotten her  into Heroin. After confronting her on this she said she was going to get  help, but instead she left in the night. I haven't heard from her in 4  years and last I've heard she's still with that guy and are homeless in  Las Vegas. Not sure how true that is, but being focused on holding it  together for the kids, I really don't have the time to chase her down,  nor do I want to after what she pulled.\\n\\nI  ended up getting a divorce in absentia. I did however maintain a very  positive relationship with my inlaws after the fact. Every other weekend  my kids stay over with their grandparents on that side and they pretty  much treat me like a son still, I still go to parties at Christmas and  am reasonably liked by the family. Nobody talks about my ex anymore  mainly to not worry my kids. My oldest, my son is very hurt by his  mother leaving. He's 9 now and I've had to get therapy for him after he  told me he hoped his mother was dead. She had been getting verbally  abusive toward the end which was when he was around 5 or 6\\n\\nAnyhow,  in the year following my ex leaving, her sister and my her boyfriend  had started coming around a lot to see the kids. They knew I worked a  lot and would babysit and call it practice as they wanted to have  children of their own. My kids love them and were spoiled by them, which  I didn't mind because we all needed a little positivity. They got  married and were very in love. However, her husband was killed in a  workplace accident shortly after the birth of their daughter.\\n\\nIt  has been extremely rough and painful for everyone involved as one can  imagine. I followed my Sil's example and began to take her daughter to  give her time to herself if things got too hard to deal with or she  needed alone time. She's been in grief counciling for a few years but  she still wears her ring and has told me she can't ever imagine dating  again. I talk to her about him frequently and she's gotten to a better  place but she's still very much in love with him, I can't imagine that  sort of pain.\\n\\nOver the last two  years we've been a more constant figure in each others lives. My kids  love their aunt and I have her over for dinner a couple times a week. My  daughter and her daughter have become close and love being around each  other so they have sleepovers. I've moved on from my ex by this but the  idea of dating possibly someone dangerous as their mother has kept me  out of the dating scene.\\n\\nI don't  know when it happened, but slowly I began to get soft on my SIL. She's a  great mom for what she's had happen to her. She's one of the sweetest  people I know and her sense of humor always leaves me laughing and  happy. Then I started realizing that I'm physically attracted to her.  I've always felt kind guilty about it because her late husband was a  good friend and since she's obviously is still grieving, so I've kept it  to myself.\\n\\nSince Covid started  we've been together a bit more because social distancing has had us lose  contact with most other people. Nothing romantic has ever been  discussed and I try not to flirt, but last week it was very late and  after the kids went to bed I made us a few drinks, not enough to get  drunk but she decided she'd rather spend the night, so I took my couch. I  woke up to breakfast this morning and the four of us felt like the sort  of family I've always wanted. She even kissed my forehead which is not  something she normally does. I still didn't say anything, but after she  left I found my son quietly playing with his toys in his room. He looked  upset so I asked him if he was alright.\\n\\nHe  tells me point blank in the way only a kid can that he wishes Sil was  his mother. I sat down with him and asked him why he thought that way  and he gave a whole bunch of reasons her being nice to him, that she  never yells about anything. He likes seeing her at his grandparents and  she draws pictures with him, which I didn't know they did. By the end of  it my heart that is already melting for this woman even more wound up.\\n\\nWhen  visiting dropping them off with their grandparents, I tried to breach  the subject with her folks to kinda feel around how people would see. I  made a joke about she and I acting like a married couple sometimes and  they didn't laugh and were kind of stand offish, friendly but either  they know something or they disapprove.\\n\\nIt's  getting too hard for me to ignore or pretend it's not getting to me.  I'm in love with her. Either I've got to kill it and find some way not  to think of her, or I have to find some sort of way to navigate through  this situation and tell her everything. If anybody out there has any  insight on how to approach a widow, especially one who was married to a  friend, with this sort of intention I could really use your help.\\n\\nTLDR-  Sil and I became close after my divorce to her sister and death of her  husband. She's great with my kids. I'm in love and don't know how to  proceed.\",\n          \"So I've been with my boyfriend for about a year and a half. He's quite stoic, not very emotional. He has a tendency of just saying or doing anything to keep the peace and hates conflict. We've sort of fallen into a pattern of me wanting things (to talk more, to do more things etc) and him doing them 'to make me happy'.\\n\\nNearly every time he does these things or I bring up that they're important to me, he says that those specific things are not important to him. Here is a list of things he's stated are not that important to him:\\n\\n* Physically being in the same place. We've recently gone long-distance (not far though, about two hours away from each other) and when I mention I would like to see him more or be together more, he says that being physically together isn't a big deal for him, or not 'as important as it is to me'. He says that he 'doesn't mind' going to see me, as long as it's not inconvenient.\\n* Sex. Our life has dropped off since we first started dating (not significantly, about twice a week now instead of five or six, not a big deal). He's mentioned before that sex just isn't that important to him. It's fine and he likes it, but not a priority. He rarely initiates anymore.\\n* Physical affection of any kind. He's not a cuddler at all, he doesn't care much for kissing (he'll mostly do it because I want it, I feel, though he hasn't stated this expressly).\\n* Communication. Since we've been together he's stated that he doesn't feel the need for any type of meaningful communication or to talk much. He will do it to please me.\\n* Doing activities together. He doesn't feel the need to do anything specific together. Doesn't see the point of dinners out, doesn't see the point of social events.\\n* Holidays together. He hates holidays, doesn't see the point in them.\\n\\nThis list goes on but these are the main ones. Also, these things came out slowly during the course of the relationship. He would do the above activities, and only later tell me he did them for me. The only activity he's ever said he enjoys doing (with me) is watching a movie together at home. He also enjoys buying little gifts for people in general) and will buy me little thoughtful gifts.\\n\\nLast night, he told me that he can't afford to come visit me (it is about a $50 flight) because he's decided to go to a wedding (his friend's ex-girlfriend's sister's, whom he has never met, don't ask) where he will spend way more than that. I've come to visit him twice in a row and can't travel during the period we're both free because my own sister is visiting during that time from Europe (he's close with my sister btw, and him not visiting will mean he won't see her as well). I said that two months of not seeing each other is long for me and that it sucked. I wasn't angry, but definitely upset, and I said I didn't want him to not go to the wedding (I actively encouraged him to go) but that I feel he doesn't ever put anything in our relationship on priority.\\n\\nHe then told me again how the same things that are important to me in the relationship aren't important to him. So I said okay, you've told me many times about the things that aren't a big deal for you/aren't a priority, and that's valid. So what IS important to you within the relationship? I said it doesn't have to be the same things as mine, but surely there is something within the relationship that is sacred or a priority for you? He said that was a loaded and unfair question and refused to say anything. He then said that some of the things I stated were important to him, just not as important as they are to me, and not something he would necessarily sacrifice other things to do. I just said goodnight and hung up after that, and now don't know what to say.\\n\\nHe is a kind person and I appreciate that he does things to make me happy, but I wish there was anything he did just because HE wanted. It must be tiring for him to constantly be doing things he doesn't want to do, and it's tiring for me to know it's always, always a chore for him. I don't know if it was bitchy of me to put him on the spot or if it's something valid that should be addressed. We are so different, but I enjoy being around him and I really do care for him. I'm just starting to feel that we are too different and want very different things.\\n\\ntl;dr my boyfriend has a list of things he doesn't consider super important in a relationship. I asked him during a semi-argument what he DOES consider important. He thought I was being unfair and has still not answered.\\n\\nedit: I really didn't expect this to blow up the way it did! Thank you to everyone who has taken the time to leave comments. I want to go through each one properly, sorry if I haven't replied to yours yet! The consensus seems to be that this isn't a relationship he's invested in and that I should cut my losses. I think this is something I've known subconsciously for a while, but to have nearly a thousand people reaffirm it makes me feel like I'm not the crazy one for once. I also think I need to visit this whole issue in therapy and explore why I feel the need to just be in a relationship, why I don't expect more for myself, and why I don't think I can do better than this.\",\n          \"My siblings (11F, 9F, 6M, 4M)and I (13M) are in the foster care system for 3 years, after being separated for one year, our foster mom agreed to take the 5 of us together.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3lxo9t/i_21f_suspect_that_i_might_be_my_boyfriend_29m_of/)\\n\\n**tl;dr** Together for 2 years. Strange behavior and circumstances makes me suspicious. Found pictures on facebook of him with a girl. Can't prove whether that girl is his \\\"ex\\\" or not. Looking for advice.\\n\\n[Update 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3rdxxz/update_i_21f_suspect_that_i_might_be_my_boyfriend/)\\n\\n**tl;dr** Y'all were right. He's a lying, cheating asshole. I found texts on his phone that Tim is still with Stephanie and that they live together. It was her in the pictures from when he went home in the summer. I'm going to break up with him and tell her about me. Any help or advice is greatly appreciated.\\n\\n\\nAgain, I'd like to start off this post with a thank you to everyone who responded with constructive and helpful advice. I read every comment, reply, and PM. \\n\\nSo, I took your advice and did not try to have a conversation with Tim. I realized that since he was so successfully able to manipulate me for two years, having one last conversation with him was bound to end up with me doubting my findings and perhaps my sanity. \\n\\nI wrote Stephanie a three page letter, detailing the relationship that Tim and I have had over the past two years. Making clear that it was serious and not just a fling. I mentioned dates and events that most people would not have known about, and I included the intricate lies and back story that he had told me. I included a list of dates from the last 2 months that he spent the night with me and encouraged her to cross check them with nights that he wasn't at home. I printed out a few photos of us as a quick visible proof, and I included the rest of the photos on a usb stick in the letter. The stick also contained screenshots of any particularly incriminating conversations that we've had over the last few months. I scanned postcards that he had sent me from various vacations and included those as well. For safe measure, I also included a copy of the letter, in case the hard copy went somehow mysteriously missing. I gave her my email address and phone number and asked her to contact me if she wanted to.\\n\\nOn Wednesday night, I had someone drive me to where she lives. If Tim was there, I would just have confirmations that he actually lives there and we'd leave. If he wasn't there, I'd ring the doorbell and hand her the letter personally. We drove the 45 km and Tim was sitting there in the living room on his laptop. It was obvious he lived there. She was nowhere to be seen. His and her names were on the mailbox. I called to see if he'd pick up and he ignored the call. We headed back home. \\n\\nOn Thursday morning, I mailed the letter. I ensured that it was registered post. In order to receive the letter she'd have to show her ID and sign for it. On Friday the letter arrived. She was not home, so she received a notification to go pick the letter up at the post office. On Saturday morning she picked it up and I got an email of the receipt with her signature on it. \\n\\nThroughout all of this, I conversed normally with Tim and made excuses as to why he couldn't come over during the week, so as to not tip him off to anything. He stopped talking to me about 20 minutes after she picked up the letter Saturday morning, and I have not heard from him since. He has, however, defriended me and my family on Facebook. I have not heard from Stephanie either.\\n\\nSo, now it's really over. I hope with my whole heart that he was not able to lie and manipulate his way out of the situation with her, but I will probably never know. I do not expect to hear from him again. \\n\\nI feel very lonely, taken advantage of, and beaten down. I am going to do my best to try to come out of this situation without trust issues and without being cynical and jaded. I am seeking therapy to make sure I don't slip into depression. For now, I need to find ways to distract myself and fill up any free time. \\n\\nThanks again for all your help, /r/relationships. This really sucks, but I'll get through it and hopefully be a stronger person for it. \\n\\n**tl;dr** Sent Stephanie the letter. Haven't heard from Tim since she received it. He defriended me on facebook. Don't expect to know any of the outcome or ever hear from him again. \\n\\n**quick edit** I forgot to mention that I'm going to go get tested on Tuesday to be safe. Obviously if anything comes out of that, I'll do my best to notify both of them. \",\n          \"My foster mom wants to adopt my siblings and I!!!

She went from being someone that I absolutely *hated* and could barely work with to just my least favorite person in the office, but no more than that.\\n\\nBut then today, I was informed by one of the other bosses that she no longer works for our firm! Apparently I wasn't just being over-sensitive or not meshing with her style as a boss, but  was correct in thinking that she was difficult to work with to the point of incompetence. \\n\\ntl;dr: I mostly figured out how to deal with the difficult coworker/boss, but then she got fired.\",\n          \"Update V: I think my husband fathered his best friend's children.  Hey everyone. This may very well be my last update for a while. I'm in therapy now, as are my children. (And, from what I hear, Amy's children are as well, so that's good.) So I should probably be focusing on healthier ways to expel my feelings. Nonetheless, I have talked to my therapist about these posts and according to her, venting anonymously online can be healthy, up to a point. If I do talk about my life again, I may do it in different sub-reddits or something, I'm still not sure. \\n\\nI have also met with the Judge now. Many were worried about how these posts might come back to bite me in the ass, legally speaking. The short answer is that they won't. The long answer is that because they're anonymous, there's technically no risk of defamation or \\\"slander.\\\" I've changed enough of the meaningless details and given everyone fake names. The posts aren't going to be relevant in the case, and I'm clear to keep writing them if I so choose, so long as I don't discuss the details of the actual case itself. Though I think the Judge would prefer I just stop writing these altogether, one of the reasons I may do so. \\n\\nWithout divulging the specifics, I went ahead and reported what I had learned, and all hell broke loose. I knew I had to do so, because Amy and Luke had changed gears after Jim passed. They began to make the case that Luke and I had always had an open marriage. That there could be no such thing as an affair, and any instances of Luke sleeping with Amy could not be counted against him. It is no accident that they chose to do this after we lost Jim. As far as I can tell, he was the only other person who knew about what Luke and Amy did, and would have done something about it. Now that they don't have to worry about that, I think they wanted to claim I always knew about the affair and that it was no true affair. When I didn't report them, they must have assumed I didn't know the truth, and they changed their story. But I knew. I reported it, and now they're fucked. \\n\\nWhich unfortunately means everyone else found out. There was no way the children wouldn't learn the truth through the grapevine. I told Sophie and Tom personally because I figured they would learn of it anyway. The others did. Tom was pretty shell shocked. I know I'm just the messenger, but I felt terrible and I wanted to comfort him, but there wasn't a whole lot I could do. Poor Kaylee did not handle it well. I'm told she had several meltdowns, and then tried to run away. I know she tried to run away because she came to our house for sanctuary. And literally, I had to give her back. I knew all the reasons I had to but I was sorely tempted to give the middle finger to all of them and let Kaylee stay with us against Amy's wishes. But no, I had to relinquish her and honestly...nothing has been harder than that was. I know it isn't my fault but I still feel like I betrayed her. \\n\\nSophie's also been dealing with a lot of anger toward her father, especially after he and Amy forced Kaylee to come back to stay with Amy again. All of this... It hit Sophie and Kaylee the hardest. Luke wanted to see Sophie again and she refused. She wouldn't come out of her room. Technically, I was supposed to let him see her, but she's fifteen years old. I told her to come out of her room, she wouldn't. So in my book, I tried. This was after Kaylee's incident so when Luke pressed me to force Sophie out of her room, I'm not proud to say I shouted at him to leave. My blood was boiling by that point. Throughout all this, my soon to be ex husband and his affair partner are still acting like I'm the bad guy. \\n\\nLuke and Amy are angry with me, and that's putting it lightly. They have no right to be but they are, or at least they're acting angry. I now have a restraining order against Amy because I was quite certain she would confront me after the fact, and she did. After I reported them, and before Kaylee came over, Amy came to the house while my kids were home, banged on the door and screamed. She was furious with me for what I had done. But I don't know what she expected me to do. I called the police, but Amy was gone by the time they showed up. They were just as useless as last time, to be honest. When Kaylee came to me for asylum, Amy came after her, but I wouldn't let her in until she called the cops herself. I would only let one of them take Kaylee, Amy was not setting foot in my house. I was very clear to explain the situation but it didn't matter. \\n\\nAmy later smeared me on social media and framed me as a kidnapper. I set the record straight without divulging too much about the circumstances of the situation, which I was tempted to do. Luke also gave me the lecture of a lifetime when I saw him, but I just kept cutting him off and spitting the facts in his face. I don't know if it's been my time away from him, but I'm learning to recognize his bullshit now where previously I fell for it every time. He always sounds so reasonable and sweet but what he's actually saying is often circular and evasive. Honestly, I am so angry with him for what he's done to his children, ALL of them. Kaylee especially. I want to adopt that girl. I know I can't, but I want to. \\n\\nCat and I had a long talk as well. So far as I can tell, she didn't know, and she's genuinely sorry for her earlier deception. Trust takes time to rebuild, but I also understand that she was in an awful position. But now that certain things have come to light, she's kind of in shambles herself, so I pity her. Not to mention, if Amy loses custody of her children, and she very well might, I'll need all the help I can get. I can't take all of them in, I don't have the space. Cat will need to do some of the leg work. So I'm trying to give her the chance to earn my trust back, sort of out of necessity.  I can't speak to the long term but if all goes as it should, Luke's not even going to be getting visitation of my kids. We'll know soon enough though, and it will be on record, if Amy's children were fathered by him. All I know is, they've always been quite certain Kaylee was, though they never had her tested. So far as I can tell, Amy hasn't really been intimate with anyone other than Luke for a long time. For the record, Cat is still supporting Amy financially, and by that I mean, she's supporting Amy's kids. I don't mind that. If Amy loses custody, that all goes away anyway. \\n\\nAs to the how and why of Luke and Amy getting together? From the letters, I've put the pieces together as best I could. Amy was sexually abused as a child and Luke was apparently the only person she felt \\\"safe\\\" exploring her sexuality with when they were in high school. It was a very bad idea and they both knew the reason it was a very bad idea well before they made that choice. As to the lie about them being \\\"surrogate siblings,\\\" apparently they always DID have that kind of relationship emotionally...but they also did this. After Tom was born (they also believe Tom to be theirs, going off the letters) the bond took on more romantic aspects as well. Amy describes Luke as \\\"my person\\\" and he says the same about her. I did read the letters in more depth for as much as it sickened me, I wanted to understand. \\n\\nI'm doing better overall, though. Personally, I'm doing better. Which makes me feel kind of guilty because nobody else is. My kids are miserable, which makes me miserable, but I know there's light at the end of the tunnel and I want them to see it. Luke and Amy are miserable, which, honestly...I'm not gonna say I'm glad about, but, I don't know what they were expecting. They've been playing a monstrous game for decades, it was always going to have consequences sooner or later. Amy's kids are miserable, especially Kaylee. I wish I could reach out to her again, but I absolutely can't except through Tom, and he needs to play this carefully. Cat is miserable too. We're all still reeling from the loss of Jim, and honestly the Kaylee incident really tore my heart in half...but I think I'm over the hump and am taking comfort in how I'm actually choosing myself for a change. \\n\\n\",\n          \"I Feel Like Myself Again! TODAY, I FEEL LIKE MYSELF AGAIN! I don't know how to explain it! I just feel.... right? For the longest time, I have struggled with depression, anxiety, and panic attacks (without therapy/ suffering in somewhat silence and without support). In addition to this, I had an eating disorder (for 6 and a half months) that took over my life, more than depression, anxiety, and panic attacks every could. I \\\"broke up\\\" with my eating disorder 5 days ago. I actually wrote out an entire letter to my ED and put it away. In the letter, I discussed why we were \\\"breaking up\\\" and why we should NEVER get back together again. It may sound weird, but, I think it worked. Today marks 2 weeks of my ED being gone. I feel energetic again, unapologetic about eating, and powerful. I feel confident. I feel like me again. My depression has lessened and so has my panic attacks. My anxiety is still not better, though, I've been struggling with that for years. I'm sorry if reading this wasted your time, it's just, I feel so happy and freed. I hope you, the reader of this post, has a magnificent, immaculate, and fantastic morning/ day/ afternoon/ evening/ night/ life in general. If you are struggling with any mental disorder, I know it's hard, tough, and just a big ball of horribleness, but I believe in you. I didn't think that I could ever feel better, but today proves that feeling better is TOTALLY POSSIBLE!

demanded that i replace all my pants and then told me she needed to supervise me while i got the replacements she is now on administrative leave update on the bulge saga i made a post a bit back about an insane demand from my boss essentially she told me that my pants were too revealing and that they showed by bulge they do not she then told me that i needed to replace my work pants if you want to read my original post you can find it here to recap what advice i got from my original thread here it is go talk to hr never talk to hr go talk to a lawyer lawyer will waste your time your pants are fine you need new pants she wants to bang you she hates you after dwelling a little bit on my options i settled for a middleoftheroad approach i contacted two wellknown lawyers in my area and got a consultation from them about my situation they both thought that while i was sexually harassed the case wasnt bulletproof as there was little evidence and no pattern of abuse they then also warned me about going to hr without any evidence as it can cascade into me losing my job in unexpected ways fine since i needed evidence and a pattern of abuse i first wanted to read up on what standards my company has set for managers when it comes to dealing with sexual harassment i requested from our online learning catalogue to take the sexualharassment and tough conversations courses that are normally required only for managers in the though conversations module there was a scenario where a male supervisor needed to ask a female employee to correct her work outfit as it did not meet the companys dress code the module in plain english states that the supervisor is not to intervene and to refer the issue to hr i assume that the inverse a female supervisor reprimanding a males outfit would follow the same standards i then sent an email to my boss asking her to follow up on our previous conversation i wrote to boss i want to clarify some things regarding our previous conversation please confirm whether or not my understanding of your statements is correct my pants violated our dress code by being too tight and revealing my bulge the issue pertains to all my pants not a specific subset of my wardrobe this is a requirement from management and not a request please get back to me sincerely utransparentvoices it took over a full work day but the response i got was to utransparentvoices yes i did tell you to fix your wardrobe this is not a request boss mfw i immediately replied to boss if management is demanding that i replace such a large amount of work clothing it must be done at the expense of company name please let me know if this is possible as we will have to work something else out if it isnt sincerely utransparentvoices and her response later was utransparentvoices this can be done but i must be with you to supervise your shopping check my schedule for my availability good lord suddenly the she wants to bang you theories seemed less crazy i backed up the emails to a personal account and sent everything to hr less than two hours later i receive a phone call asking me to come to hr immediately and drop my work unless it was timecritical i complied i was told that they were taking this matter very seriously and that i should take the rest of the day off i came back to work today and boss is gone i was told right before lunch that she had been placed on administrative leave pending a full investigation and that i shouldnt worry its against company policy to engage in any form of professional retaliation i sit here now like a king on a porcelain throne telling you about my victory during my postlunch dump byebye boss lady tldr boss sexually harassed me about my nonexistent pants bulge then demanded she take me shopping to replace all my pants she is now probably going to be fired\",\n          \"update v i think my husband fathered his best friends children hey everyone this may very well be my last update for a while im in therapy now as are my children and from what i hear amys children are as well so thats good so i should probably be focusing on healthier ways to expel my feelings nonetheless i have talked to my therapist about these posts and according to her venting anonymously online can be healthy up to a point if i do talk about my life again i may do it in different subreddits or something im still not sure i have also met with the judge now many were worried about how these posts might come back to bite me in the ass legally speaking the short answer is that they wont the long answer is that because theyre anonymous theres technically no risk of defamation or slander ive changed enough of the meaningless details and given everyone fake names the posts arent going to be relevant in the case and im clear to keep writing them if i so choose so long as i dont discuss the details of the actual case itself though i think the judge would prefer i just stop writing these altogether one of the reasons i may do so without divulging the specifics i went ahead and reported what i had learned and all hell broke loose i knew i had to do so because amy and luke had changed gears after jim passed they began to make the case that luke and i had always had an open marriage that there could be no such thing as an affair and any instances of luke sleeping with amy could not be counted against him it is no accident that they chose to do this after we lost jim as far as i can tell he was the only other person who knew about what luke and amy did and would have done something about it now that they dont have to worry about that i think they wanted to claim i always knew about the affair and that it was no true affair when i didnt report them they must have assumed i didnt know the truth and they changed their story but i knew i reported it and now theyre fucked which unfortunately means everyone else found out there was no way the children wouldnt learn the truth through the grapevine i told sophie and tom personally because i figured they would learn of it anyway the others did tom was pretty shell shocked i know im just the messenger but i felt terrible and i wanted to comfort him but there wasnt a whole lot i could do poor kaylee did not handle it well im told she had several meltdowns and then tried to run away i know she tried to run away because she came to our house for sanctuary and literally i had to give her back i knew all the reasons i had to but i was sorely tempted to give the middle finger to all of them and let kaylee stay with us against amys wishes but no i had to relinquish her and honestlynothing has been harder than that was i know it isnt my fault but i still feel like i betrayed her sophies also been dealing with a lot of anger toward her father especially after he and amy forced kaylee to come back to stay with amy again all of this it hit sophie and kaylee the hardest luke wanted to see sophie again and she refused she wouldnt come out of her room technically i was supposed to let him see her but shes fifteen years old i told her to come out of her room she wouldnt so in my book i tried this was after kaylees incident so when luke pressed me to force sophie out of her room im not proud to say i shouted at him to leave my blood was boiling by that point throughout all this my soon to be ex husband and his affair partner are still acting like im the bad guy luke and amy are angry with me and thats putting it lightly they have no right to be but they are or at least theyre acting angry i now have a restraining order against amy because i was quite certain she would confront me after the fact and she did after i reported them and before kaylee came over amy came to the house while my kids were home banged on the door and screamed she was furious with me for what i had done but i dont know what she expected me to do i called the police but amy was gone by the time they showed up they were just as useless as last time to be honest when kaylee came to me for asylum amy came after her but i wouldnt let her in until she called the cops herself i would only let one of them take kaylee amy was not setting foot in my house i was very clear to explain the situation but it didnt matter amy later smeared me on social media and framed me as a kidnapper i set the record straight without divulging too much about the circumstances of the situation which i was tempted to do luke also gave me the lecture of a lifetime when i saw him but i just kept cutting him off and spitting the facts in his face i dont know if its been my time away from him but im learning to recognize his bullshit now where previously i fell for it every time he always sounds so reasonable and sweet but what hes actually saying is often circular and evasive honestly i am so angry with him for what hes done to his children all of them kaylee especially i want to adopt that girl i know i cant but i want to cat and i had a long talk as well so far as i can tell she didnt know and shes genuinely sorry for her earlier deception trust takes time to rebuild but i also understand that she was in an awful position but now that certain things have come to light shes kind of in shambles herself so i pity her not to mention if amy loses custody of her children and she very well might ill need all the help i can get i cant take all of them in i dont have the space cat will need to do some of the leg work so im trying to give her the chance to earn my trust back sort of out of necessity i cant speak to the long term but if all goes as it should lukes not even going to be getting visitation of my kids well know soon enough though and it will be on record if amys children were fathered by him all i know is theyve always been quite certain kaylee was though they never had her tested so far as i can tell amy hasnt really been intimate with anyone other than luke for a long time for the record cat is still supporting amy financially and by that i mean shes supporting amys kids i dont mind that if amy loses custody that all goes away anyway as to the how and why of luke and amy getting together from the letters ive put the pieces together as best i could amy was sexually abused as a child and luke was apparently the only person she felt safe exploring her sexuality with when they were in high school it was a very bad idea and they both knew the reason it was a very bad idea well before they made that choice as to the lie about them being surrogate siblings apparently they always did have that kind of relationship emotionallybut they also did this after tom was born they also believe tom to be theirs going off the letters the bond took on more romantic aspects as well amy describes luke as my person and he says the same about her i did read the letters in more depth for as much as it sickened me i wanted to understand im doing better overall though personally im doing better which makes me feel kind of guilty because nobody else is my kids are miserable which makes me miserable but i know theres light at the end of the tunnel and i want them to see it luke and amy are miserable which honestlyim not gonna say im glad about but i dont know what they were expecting theyve been playing a monstrous game for decades it was always going to have consequences sooner or later amys kids are miserable especially kaylee i wish i could reach out to her again but i absolutely cant except through tom and he needs to play this carefully cat is miserable too were all still reeling from the loss of jim and honestly the kaylee incident really tore my heart in halfbut i think im over the hump and am taking comfort in how im actually choosing myself for a change\",\n          \"i am utterly incapable of getting any school work done the amount of missing essays note sheets coursework etc that i need to hand in is outstanding ive got so many emails from teachers telling me i need to hand my shit in soon stuff that was due a month ago that i havent even started idk why i cant do it when i actually get far enough to open up my laptop and get the pages that i need i just end up writing a sentence staring at my screen for ages and then giving up and when i dont get that far i literally just lay around on my phone pretending its not a problem with online lessons as well its so hard to convince myself that its not actually optional and i have to go usually i either dont show up or on rarer occasions i show up and then put it in the background and dont pay attention at all idk whats wrong with me ive been unmotivated like this for a long time but its only in recent years that its gotten this bad i used to do homework on the night beforemorning of but now i just dont do it and hope i wont get told off too badly ive tried so many things pomodoro reward systems breaking tasks down into super small bites focusing on how important school is for my future short time limits smaller tasks first bigger tasks first etc ive read hundreds of how to get motivated articles and the advice never helps every time i start to work on something i just end up not doing itthinking ill do it tomorrow and then not idk what to do its pathetic how incapable i am tbh\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

demanded that i replace all my pants and then told me she needed to supervise me while i got the replacements she is now on administrative leave update on the bulge saga i made a post a bit back about an insane demand from my boss essentially she told me that my pants were too revealing and that they showed by bulge they do not she then told me that i needed to replace my work pants if you want to read my original post you can find it here to recap what advice i got from my original thread here it is go talk to hr never talk to hr go talk to a lawyer lawyer will waste your time your pants are fine you need new pants she wants to bang you she hates you after dwelling a little bit on my options i settled for a middleoftheroad approach i contacted two wellknown lawyers in my area and got a consultation from them about my situation they both thought that while i was sexually harassed the case wasnt bulletproof as there was little evidence and no pattern of abuse they then also warned me about going to hr without any evidence as it can cascade into me losing my job in unexpected ways fine since i needed evidence and a pattern of abuse i first wanted to read up on what standards my company has set for managers when it comes to dealing with sexual harassment i requested from our online learning catalogue to take the sexualharassment and tough conversations courses that are normally required only for managers in the though conversations module there was a scenario where a male supervisor needed to ask a female employee to correct her work outfit as it did not meet the companys dress code the module in plain english states that the supervisor is not to intervene and to refer the issue to hr i assume that the inverse a female supervisor reprimanding a males outfit would follow the same standards i then sent an email to my boss asking her to follow up on our previous conversation i wrote to boss i want to clarify some things regarding our previous conversation please confirm whether or not my understanding of your statements is correct my pants violated our dress code by being too tight and revealing my bulge the issue pertains to all my pants not a specific subset of my wardrobe this is a requirement from management and not a request please get back to me sincerely utransparentvoices it took over a full work day but the response i got was to utransparentvoices yes i did tell you to fix your wardrobe this is not a request boss mfw i immediately replied to boss if management is demanding that i replace such a large amount of work clothing it must be done at the expense of company name please let me know if this is possible as we will have to work something else out if it isnt sincerely utransparentvoices and her response later was utransparentvoices this can be done but i must be with you to supervise your shopping check my schedule for my availability good lord suddenly the she wants to bang you theories seemed less crazy i backed up the emails to a personal account and sent everything to hr less than two hours later i receive a phone call asking me to come to hr immediately and drop my work unless it was timecritical i complied i was told that they were taking this matter very seriously and that i should take the rest of the day off i came back to work today and boss is gone i was told right before lunch that she had been placed on administrative leave pending a full investigation and that i shouldnt worry its against company policy to engage in any form of professional retaliation i sit here now like a king on a porcelain throne telling you about my victory during my postlunch dump byebye boss lady tldr boss sexually harassed me about my nonexistent pants bulge then demanded she take me shopping to replace all my pants she is now probably going to be fired\",\n          \"update v i think my husband fathered his best friends children hey everyone this may very well be my last update for a while im in therapy now as are my children and from what i hear amys children are as well so thats good so i should probably be focusing on healthier ways to expel my feelings nonetheless i have talked to my therapist about these posts and according to her venting anonymously online can be healthy up to a point if i do talk about my life again i may do it in different subreddits or something im still not sure i have also met with the judge now many were worried about how these posts might come back to bite me in the ass legally speaking the short answer is that they wont the long answer is that because theyre anonymous theres technically no risk of defamation or slander ive changed enough of the meaningless details and given everyone fake names the posts arent going to be relevant in the case and im clear to keep writing them if i so choose so long as i dont discuss the details of the actual case itself though i think the judge would prefer i just stop writing these altogether one of the reasons i may do so without divulging the specifics i went ahead and reported what i had learned and all hell broke loose i knew i had to do so because amy and luke had changed gears after jim passed they began to make the case that luke and i had always had an open marriage that there could be no such thing as an affair and any instances of luke sleeping with amy could not be counted against him it is no accident that they chose to do this after we lost jim as far as i can tell he was the only other person who knew about what luke and amy did and would have done something about it now that they dont have to worry about that i think they wanted to claim i always knew about the affair and that it was no true affair when i didnt report them they must have assumed i didnt know the truth and they changed their story but i knew i reported it and now theyre fucked which unfortunately means everyone else found out there was no way the children wouldnt learn the truth through the grapevine i told sophie and tom personally because i figured they would learn of it anyway the others did tom was pretty shell shocked i know im just the messenger but i felt terrible and i wanted to comfort him but there wasnt a whole lot i could do poor kaylee did not handle it well im told she had several meltdowns and then tried to run away i know she tried to run away because she came to our house for sanctuary and literally i had to give her back i knew all the reasons i had to but i was sorely tempted to give the middle finger to all of them and let kaylee stay with us against amys wishes but no i had to relinquish her and honestlynothing has been harder than that was i know it isnt my fault but i still feel like i betrayed her sophies also been dealing with a lot of anger toward her father especially after he and amy forced kaylee to come back to stay with amy again all of this it hit sophie and kaylee the hardest luke wanted to see sophie again and she refused she wouldnt come out of her room technically i was supposed to let him see her but shes fifteen years old i told her to come out of her room she wouldnt so in my book i tried this was after kaylees incident so when luke pressed me to force sophie out of her room im not proud to say i shouted at him to leave my blood was boiling by that point throughout all this my soon to be ex husband and his affair partner are still acting like im the bad guy luke and amy are angry with me and thats putting it lightly they have no right to be but they are or at least theyre acting angry i now have a restraining order against amy because i was quite certain she would confront me after the fact and she did after i reported them and before kaylee came over amy came to the house while my kids were home banged on the door and screamed she was furious with me for what i had done but i dont know what she expected me to do i called the police but amy was gone by the time they showed up they were just as useless as last time to be honest when kaylee came to me for asylum amy came after her but i wouldnt let her in until she called the cops herself i would only let one of them take kaylee amy was not setting foot in my house i was very clear to explain the situation but it didnt matter amy later smeared me on social media and framed me as a kidnapper i set the record straight without divulging too much about the circumstances of the situation which i was tempted to do luke also gave me the lecture of a lifetime when i saw him but i just kept cutting him off and spitting the facts in his face i dont know if its been my time away from him but im learning to recognize his bullshit now where previously i fell for it every time he always sounds so reasonable and sweet but what hes actually saying is often circular and evasive honestly i am so angry with him for what hes done to his children all of them kaylee especially i want to adopt that girl i know i cant but i want to cat and i had a long talk as well so far as i can tell she didnt know and shes genuinely sorry for her earlier deception trust takes time to rebuild but i also understand that she was in an awful position but now that certain things have come to light shes kind of in shambles herself so i pity her not to mention if amy loses custody of her children and she very well might ill need all the help i can get i cant take all of them in i dont have the space cat will need to do some of the leg work so im trying to give her the chance to earn my trust back sort of out of necessity i cant speak to the long term but if all goes as it should lukes not even going to be getting visitation of my kids well know soon enough though and it will be on record if amys children were fathered by him all i know is theyve always been quite certain kaylee was though they never had her tested so far as i can tell amy hasnt really been intimate with anyone other than luke for a long time for the record cat is still supporting amy financially and by that i mean shes supporting amys kids i dont mind that if amy loses custody that all goes away anyway as to the how and why of luke and amy getting together from the letters ive put the pieces together as best i could amy was sexually abused as a child and luke was apparently the only person she felt safe exploring her sexuality with when they were in high school it was a very bad idea and they both knew the reason it was a very bad idea well before they made that choice as to the lie about them being surrogate siblings apparently they always did have that kind of relationship emotionallybut they also did this after tom was born they also believe tom to be theirs going off the letters the bond took on more romantic aspects as well amy describes luke as my person and he says the same about her i did read the letters in more depth for as much as it sickened me i wanted to understand im doing better overall though personally im doing better which makes me feel kind of guilty because nobody else is my kids are miserable which makes me miserable but i know theres light at the end of the tunnel and i want them to see it luke and amy are miserable which honestlyim not gonna say im glad about but i dont know what they were expecting theyve been playing a monstrous game for decades it was always going to have consequences sooner or later amys kids are miserable especially kaylee i wish i could reach out to her again but i absolutely cant except through tom and he needs to play this carefully cat is miserable too were all still reeling from the loss of jim and honestly the kaylee incident really tore my heart in halfbut i think im over the hump and am taking comfort in how im actually choosing myself for a change\",\n          \"i am utterly incapable of getting any school work done the amount of missing essays note sheets coursework etc that i need to hand in is outstanding ive got so many emails from teachers telling me i need to hand my shit in soon stuff that was due a month ago that i havent even started idk why i cant do it when i actually get far enough to open up my laptop and get the pages that i need i just end up writing a sentence staring at my screen for ages and then giving up and when i dont get that far i literally just lay around on my phone pretending its not a problem with online lessons as well its so hard to convince myself that its not actually optional and i have to go usually i either dont show up or on rarer occasions i show up and then put it in the background and dont pay attention at all idk whats wrong with me ive been unmotivated like this for a long time but its only in recent years that its gotten this bad i used to do homework on the night beforemorning of but now i just dont do it and hope i wont get told off too badly ive tried so many things pomodoro reward systems breaking tasks down into super small bites focusing on how important school is for my future short time limits smaller tasks first bigger tasks first etc ive read hundreds of how to get motivated articles and the advice never helps every time i start to work on something i just end up not doing itthinking ill do it tomorrow and then not idk what to do its pathetic how incapable i am tbh\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n
